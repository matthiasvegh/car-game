We're aiming to develop a car game, which can be played against AI opponents, controlled by a nerual network.

The car physics are based on this tutorial: http://www.asawicki.info/Mirror/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games.html
The neural network implementation is based on: http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/evolved/nnt1.html
